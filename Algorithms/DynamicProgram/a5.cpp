/*Minimum number of jumps to reach end
Difficulty Level : Medium
Last Updated : 12 Apr, 2021
 
Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). If an element is 0, they cannot move through that element. If the end isnâ€™t reachable, return -1.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 8 -> 9)
Explanation: Jump from 1st element 
to 2nd element as there is only 1 step, 
now there are three options 5, 8 or 9. 
If 8 or 9 is chosen then the end node 9 
can be reached. So 3 jumps are made.

Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 10
Explanation: In every step a jump 
is needed so the count of jumps is 10.
The first element is 1, so can only go to 3. The second element is 3, so can make at most 3 steps eg to 5 or 8 or 9.*/
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
int minJumps(int arr[], int n)
{
    // jumps[n-1] will hold the result
    int* jumps = new int[n];
    int i, j;
 
    if (n == 0 || arr[0] == 0)
        return INT_MAX;
 
    jumps[0] = 0;
 
    // Find the minimum number of jumps to reach arr[i]
    // from arr[0], and assign this value to jumps[i]
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        jumps[i] = INT_MAX;
        for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (i <= j + arr[j] && jumps[j] != INT_MAX) {
                jumps[i] = std::min(jumps[i], jumps[j] + 1);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return jumps[n - 1];
}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    int ar[]={1,3,6,1,0,0,9};
    int size=sizeof(ar)/sizeof(ar[0]);
    std::cout<<"minimum number of jumps to reach end is "<<minJumps(ar,size)<<std::endl;
    remove(argv[0]);
    return 0;
}
