# Manacher’s Algorithm – Linear Time Longest Palindromic Substring – Part 1
Difficulty Level : Hard
Last Updated : 11 Feb, 2021
Given a string, find the longest substring which is palindrome. 

if the given string is “forgeeksskeegfor”, the output should be “geeksskeeg”
if the given string is “abaaba”, the output should be “abaaba”
if the given string is “abababa”, the output should be “abababa”
if the given string is “abcbabcbabcba”, the output should be “abcbabcbabcba”
We have already discussed Naïve [O(n3)] and quadratic [O(n2)] approaches at Set 1 and Set 2. 
In this article, we will talk about Manacher’s algorithm which finds Longest Palindromic Substring in linear time. 
One way (Set 2) to find a palindrome is to start from the center of the string and compare characters in both directions one by one. If corresponding characters on both sides (left and right of the center) match, then they will make a palindrome. 
Let’s consider string “abababa”. 
Here center of the string is 4th character (with index 3) b. If we match characters in left and right of the center, all characters match and so string “abababa” is a palindrome.

Manacher's Algorithm – Linear Time Longest Palindromic Substring

Here center position is not only the actual string character position but it could be the position between two characters also. 
Consider string “abaaba” of even length. This string is palindrome around the position between 3rd and 4th characters a and a respectively.

Manacher's Algorithm – Linear Time Longest Palindromic Substring



To find Longest Palindromic Substring of a string of length N, one way is take each possible 2*N + 1 centers (the N character positions, N-1 between two character positions and 2 positions at left and right ends), do the character match in both left and right directions at each 2*N+ 1 centers and keep track of LPS. This approach takes O(N^2) time and that’s what we are doing in Set 2. 

Let’s consider two strings “abababa” and “abaaba” as shown below:  

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltp3.jpg)
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltp4.jpg)

In these two strings, left and right side of the center positions (position 7 in 1st string and position 6 in 2nd string) are symmetric. Why? Because the whole string is palindrome around the center position. 
If we need to calculate Longest Palindromic Substring at each 2*N+1 positions from left to right, then palindrome’s symmetric property could help to avoid some of the unnecessary computations (i.e. character comparison). If there is a palindrome of some length L centered at any position P, then we may not need to compare all characters in left and right side at position P+1. We already calculated LPS at positions before P and they can help to avoid some of the comparisons after position P. 
This use of information from previous positions at a later point of time makes the Manacher’s algorithm linear. In Set 2, there is no reuse of previous information and so that is quadratic. 

Manacher’s algorithm is probably considered complex to understand, so here we will discuss it in as detailed way as we can. Some of it’s portions may require multiple reading to understand it properly. 

Let’s look at string “abababa”. In 3rd figure above, 15 center positions are shown. We need to calculate length of longest palindromic string at each of these positions. 

At position 0, there is no LPS at all (no character on left side to compare), so length of LPS will be 0.
At position 1, LPS is a, so length of LPS will be 1.
At position 2, there is no LPS at all (left and right characters a and b don’t match), so length of LPS will be 0.
At position 3, LPS is aba, so length of LPS will be 3.
At position 4, there is no LPS at all (left and right characters b and a don’t match), so length of LPS will be 0.
At position 5, LPS is ababa, so length of LPS will be 5.
…… and so on 

We store all these palindromic lengths in an array, say L. Then string S and LPS Length L look like below:  


![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltp5.jpg)

Similarly, LPS Length L of string “abaaba” will look like: 
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltp6.jpg)


In LPS Array L: 

LPS length value at odd positions (the actual character positions) will be odd and greater than or equal to 1 (1 will come from the center character itself if nothing else matches in left and right side of it)
LPS length value at even positions (the positions between two characters, extreme left and right positions) will be even and greater than or equal to 0 (0 will come when there is no match in left and right side)
Position and index for the string are two different things here. For a given string S of length N, indexes will be from 0 to N-1 (total N indexes) and positions will be from 0 to 2*N (total 2*N+1 positions). 

LPS length value can be interpreted in two ways, one in terms of index and second in terms of position. LPS value d at position I (L[i] = d) tells that: 

Substring from position i-d to i+d is a palindrome of length d (in terms of position)
Substring from index (i-d)/2 to [(i+d)/2 – 1] is a palindrome of length d (in terms of index)
e.g. in string “abaaba”, L[3] = 3 means substring from position 0 (3-3) to 6 (3+3) is a palindrome which is “aba” of length 3, it also means that substring from index 0 [(3-3)/2] to 2 [(3+3)/2 – 1] is a palindrome which is “aba” of length 3.  

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltp7.jpg)
Now the main task is to compute LPS array efficiently. Once this array is computed, LPS of string S will be centered at position with maximum LPS length value. 
We will see it in Part 2. 

# Manacher’s Algorithm – Linear Time Longest Palindromic Substring – Part 2
Difficulty Level : Expert

In Manacher’s Algorithm – Part 1, we gone through some of the basics and LPS length array.
Here we will see how to calculate LPS length array efficiently.

To calculate LPS array efficiently, we need to understand how LPS length for any position may relate to LPS length value of any previous already calculated position.
For string “abaaba”, we see following:
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltlp1.jpg)
If we look around position 3:

LPS length value at position 2 and position 4 are same
LPS length value at position 1 and position 5 are same
We calculate LPS length values from left to right starting from position 0, so we can see if we already know LPS length values at positions 1, 2 and 3 already then we may not need to calculate LPS length at positions 4 and 5 because they are equal to LPS length values at corresponding positions on left side of position 3.

If we look around position 6:
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltlp2.jpg)


LPS length value at position 5 and position 7 are same
LPS length value at position 4 and position 8 are same
…………. and so on.
If we already know LPS length values at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 already then we may not need to calculate LPS length at positions 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 because they are equal to LPS length values at corresponding positions on left side of position 6.
For string “abababa”, we see following:

                    Manacher's Algorithm – Linear Time Longest Palindromic Substring
If we already know LPS length values at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 already then we may not need to calculate LPS length at positions 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 because they are equal to LPS length values at corresponding positions on left side of position 7.

Can you see why LPS length values are symmetric around positions 3, 6, 9 in string “abaaba”? That’s because there is a palindromic substring around these positions. Same is the case in string “abababa” around position 7.
Is it always true that LPS length values around at palindromic center position are always symmetric (same)?
Answer is NO.
Look at positions 3 and 11 in string “abababa”. Both positions have LPS length 3. Immediate left and right positions are symmetric (with value 0), but not the next one. Positions 1 and 5 (around position 3) are not symmetric. Similarly, positions 9 and 13 (around position 11) are not symmetric.

At this point, we can see that if there is a palindrome in a string centered at some position, then LPS length values around the center position may or may not be symmetric depending on some situation. If we can identify the situation when left and right positions WILL BE SYMMETRIC around the center position, we NEED NOT calculate LPS length of the right position because it will be exactly same as LPS value of corresponding position on the left side which is already known. And this fact where we are avoiding LPS length computation at few positions makes Manacher’s Algorithm linear.

In situations when left and right positions WILL NOT BE SYMMETRIC around the center position, we compare characters in left and right side to find palindrome, but here also algorithm tries to avoid certain no of comparisons. We will see all these scenarios soon.

Let’s introduce few terms to proceed further:
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltlp3.jpg)
centerPosition – This is the position for which LPS length is calculated and let’s say LPS length at centerPosition is d (i.e. L[centerPosition] = d)
centerRightPosition – This is the position which is right to the centerPosition and d position away from centerPosition (i.e. centerRightPosition = centerPosition + d)
centerLeftPosition – This is the position which is left to the centerPosition and d position away from centerPosition (i.e. centerLeftPosition = centerPosition – d)
currentRightPosition – This is the position which is right of the centerPosition for which LPS length is not yet known and has to be calculated
currentLeftPosition – This is the position on the left side of centerPosition which corresponds to the currentRightPosition
centerPosition – currentLeftPosition = currentRightPosition – centerPosition
currentLeftPosition = 2* centerPosition – currentRightPosition
i-left palindrome – The palindrome i positions left of centerPosition, i.e. at currentLeftPosition
i-right palindrome – The palindrome i positions right of centerPosition, i.e. at currentRightPosition
center palindrome – The palindrome at centerPosition
When we are at centerPosition for which LPS length is known, then we also know LPS length of all positions smaller than centerPosition. Let’s say LPS length at centerPosition is d, i.e.
L[ centerPosition] = d

It means that substring between positions “centerPosition-d” to “centerPosition+d” is a palindrom.
Now we proceed further to calculate LPS length of positions greater than centerPosition.
Let’s say we are at currentRightPosition ( > centerPosition) where we need to find LPS length.
For this we look at LPS length of currentLeftPosition which is already calculated.



If LPS length of currentLeftPosition is less than “centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition”, then LPS length of currentRightPosition will be equal to LPS length of currentLeftPosition. So
L[ currentRightPosition] = L[ currentLeftPosition] if L[ currentLeftPosition] < centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition. This is Case 1.

Let’s consider below scenario for string “abababa”:

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltlp4.jpg)
We have calculated LPS length up-to position 7 where L[ 7] = 7, if we consider position 7 as centerPosition, then centerLeftPosition will be 0 and centerRightPosition will be 14.
Now we need to calculate LPS length of other positions on the right of centerPosition.

For currentRightPosition = 8, currentLeftPosition is 6 and L[ currentLeftPosition] = 0
Also centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition = 14 – 8 = 6
Case 1 applies here and so L[currentRightPosition] = L[8] = 0
Case 1 applies to positions 10 and 12, so,
L[10] = L[4] = 0
L[12] = L[2] = 0

If we look at position 9, then:
currentRightPosition = 9
currentLeftPosition = 2* centerPosition – currentRightPosition = 2*7 – 9 = 5
centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition = 14 – 9 = 5

Here L[currentLeftPosition] = centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition, so Case 1 doesn’t apply here. Also note that centerRightPosition is the extreme end position of the string. That means center palindrome is suffix of input string. In that case, L[currentRightPosition] = L[currentLeftPosition]. This is Case 2.

Case 2 applies to positions 9, 11, 13 and 14, so:
L[9] = L[5] = 5
L[11] = L[3] = 3
L[13] = L[1] = 1
L[14] = L[0] = 0

What is really happening in Case 1 and Case 2? This is just utilizing the palindromic symmetric property and without any character match, it is finding LPS length of new positions.

When a bigger length palindrome contains a smaller length palindrome centered at left side of it’s own center, then based on symmetric property, there will be another same smaller palindrome centered on the right of bigger palindrome center. If left side smaller palindrome is not prefix of bigger palindrome, then Case 1 applies and if it is a prefix AND bigger palindrome is suffix of the input string itself, then Case 2 applies.

The longest palindrome i places to the right of the current center (the i-right palindrome) is as long as the longest palindrome i places to the left of the current center (the i-left palindrome) if the i-left palindrome is completely contained in the longest palindrome around the current center (the center palindrome) and the i-left palindrome is not a prefix of the center palindrome (Case 1) or (i.e. when i-left palindrome is a prefix of center palindrome) if the center palindrome is a suffix of the entire string (Case 2).



In Case 1 and Case 2, i-right palindrome can’t expand more than corresponding i-left palindrome (can you visualize why it can’t expand more?), and so LPS length of i-right palindrome is exactly same as LPS length of i-left palindrome.

Here both i-left and i-right palindromes are completely contained in center palindrome (i.e. L[currentLeftPosition] <= centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition)
Now if i-left palindrome is not a prefix of center palindrome (L[currentLeftPosition] < centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition), that means that i-left palindrome was not able to expand up-to position centerLeftPosition.

If we look at following with centerPosition = 11, then

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltlp5.jpg)
centerLeftPosition would be 11 – 9 = 2, and centerRightPosition would be 11 + 9 = 20
If we take currentRightPosition = 15, it’s currentLeftPosition is 7. Case 1 applies here and so L[15] = 3. i-left palindrome at position 7 is “bab” which is completely contained in center palindrome at position 11 (which is “dbabcbabd”). We can see that i-right palindrome (at position 15) can’t expand more than i-left palindrome (at position 7).

If there was a possibility of expansion, i-left palindrome could have expanded itself more already. But there is no such possibility as i-left palindrome is prefix of center palindrome. So due to symmetry property, i-right palindrome will be exactly same as i-left palindrome and it can’t expand more. This makes L[currentRightPosition] = L[currentLeftPosition] in Case 1.

Now if we consider centerPosition = 19, then centerLeftPosition = 12 and centerRightPosition = 26
If we take currentRightPosition = 23, it’s currentLeftPosition is 15. Case 2 applies here and so L[23] = 3. i-left palindrome at position 15 is “bab” which is completely contained in center palindrome at position 19 (which is “babdbab”). In Case 2, where i-left palindrome is prefix of center palindrome, i-right palindrome can’t expand more than length of i-left palindrome because center palindrome is suffix of input string so there are no more character left to compare and expand. This makes L[currentRightPosition] = L[currentLeftPosition] in Case 2.

Case 1: L[currentRightPosition] = L[currentLeftPosition] applies when:

i-left palindrome is completely contained in center palindrome
i-left palindrome is NOT a prefix of center palindrome
Both above conditions are satisfied when
L[currentLeftPosition] < centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition

Case 2: L[currentRightPosition] = L[currentLeftPosition] applies when:

i-left palindrome is prefix of center palindrome (means completely contained also)
center palindrome is suffix of input string
Above conditions are satisfied when
L[currentLeftPosition] = centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition (For 1st condition) AND
centerRightPosition = 2*N where N is input string length N (For 2nd condition).



Case 3: L[currentRightPosition] > = L[currentLeftPosition] applies when:

i-left palindrome is prefix of center palindrome (and so i-left palindrome is completely contained in center palindrome)
center palindrome is NOT suffix of input string
Above conditions are satisfied when
L[currentLeftPosition] = centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition (For 1st condition) AND
centerRightPosition < 2*N where N is input string length N (For 2nd condition).
In this case, there is a possibility of i-right palindrome expansion and so length of i-right palindrome is at least as long as length of i-left palindrome.

Case 4: L[currentRightPosition] > = centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition applies when:

i-left palindrome is NOT completely contained in center palindrome
Above condition is satisfied when
L[currentLeftPosition] > centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition
In this case, length of i-right palindrome is at least as long (centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition) and there is a possibility of i-right palindrome expansion.

In following figure,
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ltlp6.jpg)
If we take center position 7, then Case 3 applies at currentRightPosition 11 because i-left palindrome at currentLeftPosition 3 is a prefix of center palindrome and i-right palindrome is not suffix of input string, so here L[11] = 9, which is greater than i-left palindrome length L[3] = 3. In the case, it is guaranteed that L[11] will be at least 3, and so in implementation, we 1st set L[11] = 3 and then we try to expand it by comparing characters in left and right side starting from distance 4 (As up-to distance 3, it is already known that characters will match).

If we take center position 11, then Case 4 applies at currentRightPosition 15 because L[currentLeftPosition] = L[7] = 7 > centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition = 20 – 15 = 5. In the case, it is guaranteed that L[15] will be at least 5, and so in implementation, we 1st set L[15] = 5 and then we try to expand it by comparing characters in left and right side starting from distance 5 (As up-to distance 5, it is already known that characters will match).

Now one point left to discuss is, when we work at one center position and compute LPS lengths for different rightPositions, how to know that what would be next center position. We change centerPosition to currentRightPosition if palindrome centered at currentRightPosition expands beyond centerRightPosition.

Here we have seen four different cases on how LPS length of a position will depend on a previous position’s LPS length.
In Part 3, we have discussed code implementation of it and also we have looked at these four cases in a different way and implement that too.

Last Updated : 18 Feb, 2021
In Manacher’s Algorithm Part 1 and Part 2, we gone through some of the basics, understood LPS length array and how to calculate it efficiently based on four cases. Here we will implement the same.
We have seen that there are no new character comparison needed in case 1 and case 2. In case 3 and case 4, necessary new comparison are needed. 
In following figure, 
 

Manacher's Algorithm – Linear Time Longest Palindromic Substring

If at all we need a comparison, we will only compare actual characters, which are at “odd” positions like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. 
Even positions do not represent a character in string, so no comparison will be preformed for even positions. 
If two characters at different odd positions match, then they will increase LPS length by 2.
There are many ways to implement this depending on how even and odd positions are handled. One way would be to create a new string 1st where we insert some unique character (say #, $ etc) in all even positions and then run algorithm on that (to avoid different way of even and odd position handling). Other way could be to work on given string itself but here even and odd positions should be handled appropriately.
Here we will start with given string itself. When there is a need of expansion and character comparison required, we will expand in left and right positions one by one. When odd position is found, comparison will be done and LPS Length will be incremented by ONE. When even position is found, no comparison done and LPS Length will be incremented by ONE (So overall, one odd and one even positions on both left and right side will increase LPS Length by TWO).
