# Write a function that returns 2 for input 1 and returns 1 for 2

Write a function which returns 1 that 2 is passed and return 2 when 1 is passed.

A simple solution is to compare the passed value with 1 and 2.
```cpp
int invert(int x)
{
   if (x == 1) return 2;
   else return 1;
}
```
Another solution is to use subtraction
```cpp
int invertSub(int x)
{
   return (3-x);
}
```
We can also use bitwise xor operator.


```cpp
int invertXOR(int x)
{
   return (x ^ 1 ^ 2);
}
```
