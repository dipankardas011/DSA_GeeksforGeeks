# Two Dimensional Binary Indexed Tree or Fenwick Tree

Prerequisite – Fenwick Tree

We know that to answer range sum queries on a 1-D array efficiently, binary indexed tree (or Fenwick Tree) is the best choice (even better than segment tree due to less memory requirements and a little faster than segment tree).

`Can we answer sub-matrix sum queries efficiently using Binary Indexed Tree ?`

The answer is yes. This is possible using a 2D BIT which is nothing but an array of 1D BIT.

Algorithm:


We consider the below example. Suppose we have to find the sum of all numbers inside the highlighted area-

We assume the origin of the matrix at the bottom – O.Then a 2D BIT exploits the fact that-

  
`Sum under the marked area = Sum(OB) - Sum(OD) - 
                            Sum(OA) + Sum(OC) `

In our program, we use the getSum(x, y) function which finds the sum of the matrix from (0, 0) to (x, y).
Hence the below formula :

`
Sum under the marked area = Sum(OB) - Sum(OD) - 
                            Sum(OA) + Sum(OC) 
The above formula gets reduced to,
Query(x1,y1,x2,y2) = getSum(x2, y2) - 
                     getSum(x2, y1-1) - 
                     getSum(x1-1, y2) + 
                     getSum(x1-1, y1-1) 
`

where,
x1, y1 = x and y coordinates of C
x2, y2 = x and y coordinates of B

The updateBIT(x, y, val) function updates all the elements under the region – (x, y) to (N, M) where,
N = maximum X co-ordinate of the whole matrix.
M = maximum Y co-ordinate of the whole matrix.

The rest procedure is quite similar to that of 1D Binary Indexed Tree. Below is the C++ implementation of 2D indexed tree
